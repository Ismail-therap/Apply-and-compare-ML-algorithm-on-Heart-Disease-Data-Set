# Apply and Compare ML Algorithms on Heart Disease Data Set

## Introduction
In this project, we will apply and compare different machine learning algorithms on the Heart Disease Data Set. The goal is to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on various health parameters.

## Data Set
The data set used in this project can be found here. It consists of 303 samples with 14 columns, including age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, and presence of heart disease.

## Machine Learning Algorithms
The following algorithms will be applied and compared in this project:

1. Logistic Regression [Simplest one but many cases most effective and easy to interpret]
2. Random Forest [Tree-based algorithm]
3. XGBoost [Effective in many cases]
4. Neural Network (Basic)
5. CNN [Not yet sure]

## Results
The performance of each algorithm will be evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results will be compared to determine the best algorithm for predicting heart disease in patients.

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide a comparative analysis of different machine learning algorithms applied to the Heart Disease Data Set. The final model can be used to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on their health parameters.
