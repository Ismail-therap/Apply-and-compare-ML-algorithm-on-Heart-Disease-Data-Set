# Apply and Compare ML Algorithms on Heart Disease Data Set

## Introduction
In this project, we will apply and compare different machine learning algorithms on the Heart Disease Data Set. The goal is to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on various health parameters.

## Data Set
The data set used in this project can be found here. It consists of 299 complete samples with 14 columns, including age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, and presence of heart disease.

## Machine Learning Algorithms
We will use language models and few convensional models to compare their performance in classifying the heart patients. 

### Supervised:
1. Logistic Regression [Simplest one but many cases most effective and easy to interpret]
2. Random Forest [Tree-based algorithm]

### Unsupervised:
1. K-means clustering
2. SOM

### Language Models:
1. LSTM
2. BERT or Fasttext
